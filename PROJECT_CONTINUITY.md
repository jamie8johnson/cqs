# Project Continuity

## Right Now

Releasing v0.1.16 with audit fixes:
- Tracing spans added to major operations
- Embedding type encapsulated (private field)
- Version check on index open
- Documentation fixes

Tags v0.1.12-15 were created (were missing). Need to merge to main and publish.

## Parked

- C and Java language support (no user requests yet)
- Code-specific embedding model (CodeSage, Qwen3-Embedding)
- Mock embedder for unit tests (needs trait abstraction)

## Open Questions

None.

## Blockers

None.

## Pending Changes

Branch: add-1.0-criteria
