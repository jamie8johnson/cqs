# Project Continuity

## Right Now

Competitor analysis done. Key insight: Greptile translates code→NL before embedding for better results.

## Parked

- C and Java language support (no user requests yet)
- Code→NL→Embed pipeline (Greptile approach) - high priority improvement
- Code-specific embedding model (CodeSage, Qwen3-Embedding)
- Call graph analysis (grepai has this)

## Open Questions

None.

## Blockers

None.

## Pending Changes

- Grammar updates (rust 0.24, python 0.25)
- MCP: `semantic_only` param, HNSW status in stats
- Doc consolidation (tears system overhaul)
- SCARS.md (new file)
